            <h1>What is EVIX anyway?</h1>
            <p>
                As you probably saw on our main page, EVIX stands for the Experimental Virtual Internet Exchange. For
                those who are not familiar with how the internet works, every computer, whether that be your phone or
                one of the many servers used by Google, must know how to navigate the large number of connections
                running all over the Earth. Your phone must know how to get to Google and Google must know how to send
                the reply back to your phone. Since there are many internet service providers in the world, it would be
                impossible for them all to connect directly to each other. So we have a protocol called BGP that your
                ISP to tell the other ISPs that it connects to that it knows how to get to your phone. All of those ISPs
                then forward that message to all of the ISPs that it is connected to until the whole world knows the
                route.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if a connection has to go through many ISPs, it is going to take longer. So having direct
                connections to more ISPs is usually a good thing. Many ISPs of the same size may connect to each other
                for free since they both receive benefit by doing that. But once you have more than a few ISPs, the
                number of direct connections grows quickly. Each new ISP would have to connect to every existing one. We
                have almost 200 member so each new member would have to connect to 200 other members!
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can probably guess, there is a better way. That's with an internet exchange. An internet exchange
                allows many ISPs or other networks in a close by area to make a single connection to the internet
                exchange which then acts as if they were directly connected to all of the other members.
            </p>
            <p>
                But traditional IXs can be very expensive and are generally only available to those who store servers in
                the same facility. This is reasonable for businesses but for hobbyists like the members of EVIX, it is
                very expensive. That's why we created EVIX, to support the network engineers of the future. EVIX allows
                our members to learn how real internet exchanges work with almost no cost. The skills that they learn
                can be transferred directly to future jobs and experiences. It's been an amazing learning opportunity
                for those of us running EVIX as well since it has allowed us to learn what it is like to develop in an
                environment where hundreds of people are counting on our work and have special questions or issues that
                we never thought of.
            </p>

            <h1>Our Goals</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We want to provide a low barrier to entry opportunity for hobbyists and the like to get experience
                    with as close to a real internet exchange as we can provide.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is also important that we automate the entire process as much as possible. For the sake of learning,
                    reducing the workload on our volunteers, and supporting other internet exchanges in their own automation.
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>What is an Internet Exchange?</h1>
            <p>An IX (Internet Exchange) allows networks to interconnect on an open-access ethernet fabric -- providing
                low-latency, high-bandwidth, cost-effectively, in a locale.</p>

            <h1>What is a Virtual Internet Exchange</h1>
            <p>A Virtual Internet Exchange simulates a real Internet Exchange Point using tunnels and virtualized
                switches. It has the advantage of allowing remote users with public resources to peer in a more
                automated manner.</p>
            <p>Note that while traditional Internet Exchanges generally decrease latency and increase bandwidth, EVIX
                makes no such guarantee. In fact, EVIX may potentially increase latency (for example if 2 people on the
                East Coast need to send traffic to each other via our West Coast switch).</p>
            <p>EVIX's primary purpose is for research and education, and should not be expected to increase Internet
                performance.</p>

            <h1>How is traffic exchanged?</h1>
            <p>EVIX uses OpenVPN, EoIP, ZeroTier or VXLAN tunnels to establish layer 2 connectivity and exchange IP and
                IPv6 data. As with any Internet Exchange peers use BGP to send routes to each other.</p>

            <h1>Where is EVIX?</h1>
            <p>Right now we have three POPs; our primary switch is in Fremont, California and we have extension switches
                in the Netherlands and New Zealand. We are planning additional sites to further reduce latency.</p>
            <p>PeeringDB: peeringdb.com/ix/2274</p>

            <h1>How much does it cost?</h1>
            <p>Participating in EVIX is free, although we do appreciate any donations to keep the infrastructure
                running.</p>

            <h1>How do I join?</h1>
            <p>Anyone who holds public resources (ASN and IPv4/IPv6) is free to join EVIX to gain experience with BGP
                and routing. To get started first fill out the peering request form on our contact page</p>
