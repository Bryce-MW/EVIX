            <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
            <h2>These are the core objectives of EVIX:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide a 0 cost, low-barrier Internet Exchange Point for users holding public resources to
                    experiment with BGP and routing protocols.
                </li>
                <li>Facilitate tunnel-based peering in a more automated manner.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>What is an Internet Exchange?</h1>
            <p>An IX (Internet Exchange) allows networks to interconnect on an open-access ethernet fabric -- providing
                low-latency, high-bandwidth, cost-effectively, in a locale.</p>

            <h1>What is a Virtual Internet Exchange</h1>
            <p>A Virtual Internet Exchange simulates a real Internet Exchange Point using tunnels and virtualized
                switches. It has the advantage of allowing remote users with public resources to peer in a more
                automated manner.</p>
            <p>Note that while traditional Internet Exchanges generally decrease latency and increase bandwidth, EVIX
                makes no such guarentee. In fact, EVIX may potentially increase latency (for example if 2 people on the
                East Coast need to send traffic to each other via our West Coast switch).</p>
            <p>EVIX's primary purpose is for research and education, and should not be expected to increase Internet
                performance.</p>

            <h1>How is traffic exchanged?</h1>
            <p>EVIX uses OpenVPN, EoIP, ZeroTier or VXLAN tunnels to establish layer 2 connectivity and exchange IP and
                IPv6 data. As with any Internet Exchange peers use BGP to send routes to each other.</p>

            <h1>Where is EVIX?</h1>
            <p>Right now we have three POPs; our primary switch is in Fremont, California and we have extension switches
                in the Netherlands and New Zealand. We are planning additional sites to further reduce latency.</p>
            <p>PeeringDB: peeringdb.com/ix/2274</p>

            <h1>How much does it cost?</h1>
            <p>Participating in EVIX is free, although we do appreciate any donations to keep the infrastructure
                running.</p>

            <h1>How do I join?</h1>
            <p>Anyone who holds public resources (ASN and IPv4/IPv6) is free to join EVIX to gain experience with BGP
                and routing. To get started first fill out the peering request form on our contact page</p>
