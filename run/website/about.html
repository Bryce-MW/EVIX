            <h1>What is EVIX anyway?</h1>
            <p>
                As you probably saw on our main page, EVIX stands for the Experimental Virtual Internet Exchange. For
                those who are not familiar with how the internet works, I'll start with the basics. Whether that be your
                phone or one of the many servers used by <a href="https://www.google.ca/about/datacenters/"
                target="_blank" rel="external">Google</a>, every computer must know how to navigate the large number of
                connections running all over the Earth. Your phone must know how to get to Google, and Google must know
                how to send the reply back to your phone. Since there are <a href="https://isp.today/" target="_blank"
                rel="external">many internet service providers</a> globally, it would be impossible for them all to
                connect directly to each other. So we have a protocol called BGP that your ISP uses to tell the other
                ISPs that it connects to that it knows how to get to your phone. All of those ISPs then forward that
                message to all of the ISPs that they are connected to until the whole world knows the route.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if a connection has to go through many ISPs, it is going to take longer. So having direct links to
                more ISPs is usually a good thing. Many ISPs of the same size may <a
                href="https://www.thousandeyes.com/learning/techtorials/isp-peering" target="_blank"
                rel="external">connect for free</a> since they both receive benefits by doing that. But once you have
                more than a few ISPs, the number of direct connections multiplies. Each new ISP would have to connect to
                every existing one. We have almost 200 members, so each new member would have to connect to 200 existing
                members!
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can probably guess, there is a better way. That's with an internet exchange. An internet exchange
                allows many ISPs or other networks in a close area to make a single connection to the internet exchange,
                which then acts as if they were directly connected to all of the other members.
            </p>
            <p>
                But traditional IXs can be very expensive and are generally only available to those who store servers in
                the same facility. This is reasonable for businesses. For hobbyists like the members of EVIX, it is
                prohibitively expensive. That's why we created EVIX to support the network engineers of the future. EVIX
                allows our members to learn how real internet exchanges work at almost no cost. The skills that they
                learn can be transferred directly to future jobs and experiences. It's been a fantastic learning
                opportunity for those of us running EVIX since it has allowed us to learn what it is like to develop in
                an environment where hundreds of people are counting on our work and have particular questions or issues
                that we never thought about.
            </p>

            <h1>Our Goals</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We want to provide a low barrier to entry opportunity for hobbyists and the like to get experience
                    with as close to an actual internet exchange as we can provide.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is also vital that we automate the entire process as much as possible for the sake of learning,
                    reducing the workload on our volunteers, and supporting other internet exchanges in their
                    automation.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h1>Supported Connection Types</h1>
            <p>
                Because internet exchanges allow each member to determine their policy with all of the other networks
                connected to the exchange, it is required that we use connection types that support the tunnelling of
                packets on layer 2 of the OSI model. This is the layer that Ethernet and MAC addresses work at. Please
                note that the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnelling protocol is not supported since it can only
                tunnel layer three packets. GRE-TAP is an extension that can transport layer two packets, but it has
                inconsistent implementations that often lead to unresolvable issues. For that reason, we do not support
                it. However, we do support the following connection types.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN)</li>
                <li>Ethernet over IP (EoIP)</li>
                <li>OpenVPN</li>
                <li>ZeroTier</li>
                <li>Local Ethernet</li>
                <li>Custom Layer 2 Transit</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We are open to trying other protocols that work on layer two as well. Let us know in your ticket.
            </p>

                into the repository at the moment. It is more meant to be used as a reference for those who have come
                across similar issues. For example, we have a few <a

                Essentially, please do not outright copy our website design or text or utilize all of our scripts
                together as a whole. But in general, we are happy to see our code used by others. If in doubt, send us
                an email, and we will be glad to chat. We can also give you some tips or help you when something is not
                adequately explained.

            <h1>Donate</h1>
            <p>
                At one point, we were accepting donations by PayPal. We are looking into overhauling the donation
                system, but this has not been done yet. For now, let us know by email if you wish to donate, and we can
                help you out with that. We also greatly accept donations of hardware, software, rack space, transit, and
                sometimes VMs for new POPs if it is in an area where we have little presence. We would currently be open
                to a POP on the east coast of Canada or the USA, Asia, Africa, or South America. If you have another
                idea for a POP location or have another donation idea, send us an email and let us know.
