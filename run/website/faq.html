                At the moment, we do not charge for connection to EVIX. This is for a few reasons. One of our primary
                goals is to provide a low barrier to entry opportunity for hobbyists. Many of us can not afford the high
                fees that other exchanges, even those for hobbyists, charge. We can do this because all of our
                infrastructure and resources are donated, so we have few reoccurring fees. We are happy to accept
                donations to help us with that and with expanding our resources. At one point, we considered adding a
                nominal fee of about $1/yr, but we ended up deciding against it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also don't want to feel like our members are customers. Since most of us are students or are busy
                with our own jobs, we can't provide the same level of service as a company can. If we had a mandatory
                charge, then we would be more obligated to solve issues and work on improvements. This could be
                detrimental to our own lives. There are also some cases where we can't figure out how to solve something
                from our end. Since all of our members have slightly different setups, it is up to them to solve that
                kind of issue. We don't want to feel like we must be full support agents who must solve problems that
                are not on our end. Sometimes neither of us can figure it out, and it is just best for the member to
                disconnect than spend a considerable amount of time remotely debugging their configuration.
            </p>
            <p>

                In the future, we would like to provide a way to make a reoccurring contribution to help us with our
                costs and development. Since this is a donation, we would not feel as obligated towards the previously
                mentioned issues. We could also stick to having no refunds, even in the case of an outage, since you
                would always be free to stop your contributions and still receive the same service.

                At one point, we were accepting donations by PayPal. We are looking into overhauling the donation
                system, but this has not been done yet. For now, let us know by email if you wish to donate so we can
                help you out with that. We also greatly accept donations of hardware, software, rack space, transit, and
                sometimes VMs for new POPs if it is in an area where we have little presence. We would currently be open
                to a POP on the east coast of Canada or the USA, Asia, Africa, or South America. If you have another
                idea for a POP location or have another donation idea, send us an email and let us know.

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                The internet exchange switch is a fabric shared by all peers. Peers must avoid doing anything which
                might overload the fabric, misdirect traffic, or otherwise cause harm to any other peers. If a peer
                shows a willful disregard for others, they will be disconnected by the operators. Additionally, peers
                are requested to only send traffic to destinations advertised by BGP. Do not point default routes and do
                not point static routes to other operators.
            </p>
            <p>
                Peers must maintain their connection to the IXP and allow ICMP Ping. Additionally, operators are
                required to maintain a peering session to the primary route server. Operators who do not keep their
                route server connection are automatically de-peered. If you do not wish to connect to the route servers,
                you can let us know so we can exempt you from our monitoring system. Note that this means that we can
                not send out our automated emails to let you know that your connection is down. While allowing ICMP Ping
                is technically optional, it is a critical debugging tool and disabling it will cause many issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be specific, our policy is that if one or more of your route server connections is down, we will
                email you at most once a week. If all of your route server connections come back up, this will reset.
                Technically, we go off of the connection that has been down for the longest time, so if you flip-flopped
                between which route server you were connected to, then you may not receive the emails properly. After
                three weeks, we will not send any more emails. If all of your connections are down, and the connection
                that has been down for the longest has been down for four or more weeks, we will send a final email and
                remove your connection. These warnings are per-IP. So if you have two IPs, you will receive separate
                emails for each.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that in the general case, you will receive three warning emails, once per week. After the
                fourth week, you will receive one more email removing your connection. If you only have one connection
                down, then in general, you will receive three emails, once per week, then no more. While you won't be
                bothered anymore, this is still a precarious situation because if at any time after four weeks, all of
                your remaining route server connections go down, you will be immediately removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose you have been removed but would like to join again. Please send us an email. This way, we can
                give you your old IPs back rather than allocating new ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also do not tolerate harassment of any kind. This includes support messages, private messages to
                other members (if they tell us about it), and inappropriate network names. We will let you know if we
                find you to violate this rule before making an action. This includes derogatory statements towards women
                and minorities. EVIX is inclusive to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to remove anyone that breaks one of these rules. We will try to give you notice if
                that happens. I will note that this has never happened before, but I think it is important to state our
                stance just in case.
            </p>
            <p>
                While not a rule, we request that peers register themselves with <a href="https://peeringdb.com/ix/2274"
                target="_blank" rel="external">PeeringDB</a> because visibility there will encourage other networks to
                join and bring more benefit to all.

                these are what we have found the most success with. If you find that a different configuration works
                better for you or you would like to contribute with instructions for another operating system, please
                let us know!

                For quick questions or general questions that don't require an EVIX admin to investigate, consider
                joining our <a href="https://discord.gg/dXVpp6d" target="_blank" rel="external">Discord</a>. There are
                many people on there who may be able to help you if we are busy.

            <p>
                If all else fails, open a ticket with us by <a href="mailto:helpdesk@evix.org">emailing us</a>. Since we
                are often very busy, it may be a while before we can get back to you. If possible, include as must
                information as you can so that we can solve the issue in as few emails as we can. It also helps if you
                try to solve the issue yourself and let us know what you tried. 90% of problems are solved by just
                restarting your BGP daemon a couple of times, so that's likely the first thing we would ask you to do.

                claim to have received complaints from others, leaving them with the considerable hassle of explaining
                what we are and why they don't think anyone should be involved. They also refuse to work with anyone
                involved with us as a volunteer or member unless that member removes all connections to us. We
                understand that there are disagreements on whether we should exist, but I think this person's behaviour
                has been immature. Still, we do invite conversation about the merits and demerits of EVIX on Discord or
                via email.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also a small but vocal group advocating against virtual exchanges in general, often complaining
                on mailing lists or GitHub issues. We are happy to discuss this with these people directly. Please reach
                out to us. We believe that there are good reasons for us to exist and would love to share.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to complain, please send us an email or chat on our Discord server. If anyone
                complains about us to you (unsure why they wouldn't contact us directly), please send them our way. If
                we only have complaints from one person, it is challenging for us to make improvements.

                EVIX has two types of peers, local and remote. Local peers have a <a href="https://freerangecloud.com"
                target="_blank" rel="external">Free Range Cloud</a> (Fremont, Vancouver) or <a
                href="https://ifog.ch/en/ip/ixp-access" target="_blank" rel="external">iFog</a> (Zurich, Frankfurt) VPS
                and have requested a complimentary cross-connect to the EVIX switch. Some peers also connect via
                physical cross-connect or other custom methods at our Fremont and Amsterdam locations. We are happy to
                discuss alternate methods. Currently, all of our physical cross-connects are 1G copper, but we can
                support various types of fibre at 1G and 10G as well (though a 10G connection would be of little benefit
                over a 1G connection).
            </p>
            <p>
                Remote peers use a Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol to connect to the EVIX switch without a physical presence.
                Supported tunnelling protocols are EoIP, OpenVPN, VXLAN and ZeroTier. Note that GRE and GRE-TAP are not
                supported and will never be due to ongoing issues. We are open to supporting other methods, however. All
                peers, local and remote, use BGP to exchange routing information with each other and the EVIX route
                servers.

                Just about any OS that supports one of our tunnelling protocols and BGP would likely work on EVIX. We

                provide the same level of support on other devices, but we are happy to try. If you use another OS and
                get it to work, please consider sending us your instructions so that we can add them to the example
                configuration.

                EVIX currently operates two Route Servers, one with AS137933 and one with AS209762. No other services at

                While our standard MTU is 1500, there are some cases where this causes issues (and we are not sure why).
                So one solution to some problems that people have come across is to set your MTU to 1400. So if you can
                ping the route servers but not connect to them, try setting your MTU to 1400.

                is more accurate to how we represent peers internally but may be less useful for standardized tools.

            <h2><label for="disclosure-17">Why make a virtual exchange?</label></h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Many people ask us why we made a virtual exchange rather than make a free one in a datacenter similar to
                what FCIX does. The reason is that datacenters are expensive. When I (Bryce) first started EVIX, there
                was no way that I would be able to afford a full rack, even in the datacenter that FCIX is in, which is
                very cheap. FCIX requires a whole rack to join. In many other datacenters, cross-connects cost an
                additional monthly fee. The only way we would even be able to afford to start an IX in those situations
                would be sponsorships or donations. To continue, we would likely need to charge hefty fees on top of the
                already high costs to be in the datacenter. This means that the only way to support the large number of
                hobbyists who can not afford a full rack and may not even be able to afford a VPS is to start a virtual
                exchange. There are many criticisms of virtual exchanges in general, which are covered in the following
                few points.
            </p>
        </div>

        <input hidden id="disclosure-19" type="checkbox">
        <div id="19">
            <label for="disclosure-19" tabindex="0"></label>
            <h2><label for="disclosure-19">What do you say to those who disagree with virtual exchanges?</label></h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                I won't say that all virtual exchanges are justified. While I can't speak for our members, building EVIX
                has been a valuable experience for our admins. Many of those who disagree think that we should either
                join DN42 or build an exchange in our lab (not that many of our admins could afford a lab, remember that
                many of us are students). DN42 is a great way to get started with BGP, and we highly recommend it. Some
                things just can't be learned from a lab or DN42.
            </p>
            <p>
                At EVIX, we have had to work as a team which is significantly more complex than working alone. We have
                also had to coordinate between many technologies. If you just built a lab, chances are that you would
                use the same OS for everything, or you would at least be limited to what you can think of. With EVIX, we
                have so many members asking for many different things that we would not have thought of on our own and
                now have to come up with. The large number of members has also necessitated automation that was not
                planned initially. As people count on us, there is a significant incentive to keep working on the
                project. Since it has been around for so long, we have built up tech debt which has required us to
                create new solutions for things that we have forgotten. Overall, the experience has been much closer to
                working at a company than building a project as a hobby. This has given us such invaluable experience
                that it was worth making EVIX for that reason alone.

                We are thrilled to discuss this topic, so please reach out to us! I think that we can come up with
                compromises that make everyone happy.

                when you hover over it. The logo isn't even an image. It's just an SVG underneath text. The gradient was
                inspired by the bisexual flag. Not for any reason other than that I like those colours. We will make a
                new one eventually, but this is like an in-6-to-12-months kind of later.
