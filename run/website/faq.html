        <h1>How do we contact EVIX?</h1>
        <p>Send email to <a href="mailto:helpdesk@evix.org">helpdesk@evix.org</a> for any issues.</p>

        <h1>How much do ports cost?</h1>
        <p>EVIX does not charge for participation as we believe in providing a low barrier of entry for any holders of
            public resources to participate in BGP. While we do not charge for participation, we do accept donations to
            cover the costs associated with running EVIX's infrastructure.</p>

        <h1>How do we donate to EVIX?</h1>
        <p>EVIX was built upon donations. We are very interested in receiving donations of VPS' to further extend the
            reach of our network. If you would be interested in donating resources to EVIX, please contact us by
            email:<a href="mailto: helpdesk@evix.org">helpdesk@evix.org</a> We also accept monetary donations to our
            PayPal email address: evix.org@gmail.com</p>

        <h1>What Technology is Used to Connect Peers?</h1>
        <p>EVIX has two types of peers - local and remote. Local peers have a <a href="https://freerangecloud.com">Free
            Range Cloud</a> VPS and have requested a complimentary cross connect to the EVIX switch. Remote peers use a
            layer2 tunneling protocol to connect to the EVIX switch without a physical presence. Supported tunneling
            protocols are EoIP, OpenVPN, VXLAN and ZeroTier (Experimental). All peers, local and remote, use BGP to
            exchange routing information with each other, and optionally, the EVIX route server.</p>

        <h1>Are there any rules?</h1>
        <p>
            The internet exchange switch is a fabric shared by all peers. Peers must avoid doing anything which might
            overload the fabric, mis-direct traffic, or otherwise cause harm to any other peers. If a peer shows a
            willful disregard for others, they will be disconnected by the operators. Additionally, peers are
            requested to only send traffic to destinations advertised by BGP. Do not point default routes and do
            not point static routes to other operators. Peers are required to maintain their connection to the
            IXP and allow ICMP PING, additionally operators are required to maintain a peering session to the primary
            route server. Operators who do not maintain their tunnel, or who block ICMP PING will be automatically
            de-peered.</p>
        <p>
            While not a rule, we request that peers register themselves
            with <a href="https://peeringdb.com/">PeeringDB</a>, because
            visibility there will encourage other networks to join as well,
            bringing more benefit to all.
        </p>

        <h1>What operating systems are supported?</h1>
        <p>Technically any OS that supports VPN tunneling (current protocols include OpenVPN, ZeroTier or VXLAN) and BGP
            or any version of Mikrotik RouterOS can be used. We have officially tested on Debian, VyOS 1.18 and RouterOS
            6</p>

        <h1>Are there any example configurations?</h1>
        <p>Yes! We have example configuration instructions available at: <a href="/Documents/example-config.pdf">example-config.pdf</a><br>Send
            us an email if you would like to add to this document!</p>

        <h1>What Subnets do you use?</h1>
        <p>Our IPv6 subnet is 2602:fed2:fff:ffff::/64 which has been donated by 10VPN Hosting, while our IPv4 subnet is
            206.81.104.0/24 and has been acquired directly from ARIN</p>

        <h1>What is the process for getting connected?</h1>
        <p>
            Please fill out the peering request form on our <a href="/#contact">contact page</a> and one of our staff
            will get in touch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please see our <a href="locations.html">Locations list</a> for
            the closest virtual switch to you.</p>

        <h1>Do you have a looking glass?</h1>
        <p>
            Yes! We have a public looking glass available at <a href="http://lg.evix.org">lg.evix.org</a> which shows
            all peering sessions the router is configured for.</p>

        <h1>Do you Support Communities?</h1>
        <p>Yes! Our route server currently tags routes received from each POP with a unique community depending on where
            the route originated. The currently supported communities are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fremont POP - 65517:01</li>
            <li>Netherlands POP - 65517:02</li>
            <li>New Zealand POP - 65517:03</li>
            <li>Vancouver POP - 65517:04</li>
        </ul>
        Additionally, RFC 1997 communities are supported.<p></p>

        <h1>What other services can we expect?</h1>
        <p>
            EVIX currently operates a Route Server with ASN 137933. No other services at available at this time,
            however, in future we may turn up some new services.
