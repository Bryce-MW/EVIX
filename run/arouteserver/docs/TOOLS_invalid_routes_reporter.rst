Invalid routes reporter
-----------------------

This script is intended to be used as an `ExaBGP <https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exabgp>`_ process to elaborate and report/log invalid routes received by route servers that have been previously configured using the `"tag" reject policy option <https://arouteserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONFIG.html#reject-policy>`_ of ARouteServer.
