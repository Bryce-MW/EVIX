Supported BGP speakers and features
===================================

Supported features
------------------

This section contains a list of the features offered by route server configurations which are generated by ARouteServer.

For each feature, the compatibility with the supported BGP speakers is also shown.

Legend:

- Yes = feature supported by the BGP speaker and
  implemented in the configuration generated by
  ARouteServer.

- No = feature supported by the BGP speaker but **not**
  implemented in the configuration generated by
  ARouteServer.

- N/A = feature not available in the BGP speaker.

.. warning:: **Please note**: support for BIRD v2 is in very early stages: before moving any production platform to instances of BIRD v2 configured with this tool, please review the configurations carefully and run some simulations.

For more details on the features which are not supported or partially supported, please see also the :ref:`Caveats and limitations` section of this documentation.

Integration testing coverage
----------------------------

This is a list of all the integration test cases which have been verified using the :doc:`Live tests <LIVETESTS>` framework.

An actual instance of the BGP speaker which is under testing is spun up and configured in a way that some specific features could be tested; some expectations are set, then other instances of BIRD (the clients) are used to generate a set of announcements whose behaviour is supposed to match those expectations.

Finally, the expectations are verified against the route server instance and the outcome of the tests reported in an output file, that is used to automatically build this matrix.

.. note:: Some test names are a bit cryptic: to get a better understanding of them, please refer to the README file inside the *tests/live_tests/scenarios* sub-directory of the scenario they refer to (or to the :ref:`Built-in scenarios` section of this documentation).
