BIRD hooks example
------------------

The BIRD configurations provided in this example have been generated enabling `BIRD hooks <https://arouteserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONFIG.html#site-specific-custom-config>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ arouteserver bird --ip-ver 4 --use-local-files header --use-hooks pre_receive_from_client post_receive_from_client [...]

The above list of hooks passed to the ``bird`` command has been truncated for the sake of readability; the complete list used in this example is provided below.

The command line argument ``--use-local-files`` enables the ``header`` inclusion point, in order to add the ``include "/etc/bird/header.local";`` configuration statement to the BIRD configuration generated by ARouteServer.

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 11

   define rs_as = 999;
   
   log "/var/log/bird.log" all;
   log syslog all;
   debug protocols all;
   
   protocol device {};
   
   table master sorted;
   
   include "/etc/bird/header.local";
   ...

This file must be present on the route server where BIRD is executed and must contain the custom functions used to implement the hooks. See the ``header.local`` file for the functions declaration.

List of hooks used in this example:

- pre_receive_from_client
- post_receive_from_client
- pre_announce_to_client
- post_announce_to_client
- scrub_communities_in
- scrub_communities_out
- apply_blackhole_filtering_policy
- route_can_be_announced_to
- announce_rpki_invalid_to_client
