        - "<h4>What is an Internet Exchange?</h4>
           <p>An IX (Internet Exchange) allows networks to interconnect on an open-access ethernet fabric -- providing low-latency, high-bandwidth, cost-effectively, in a locale.</p>"
        - "<h4>What is a Virtual Internet Exchange</h4>
           <p>A Virtual Internet Exchange simulates a real Internet Exchange Point using tunnels and virtulized switches.  It has the advantage of allowing remote users with public resources to peer in a more automated manner.</p>
	<p>Note that while traditional Internet Exchanges generally decrease latency and increase bandwidth, EVIX makes no such guarentee.  In fact, EVIX may potentially increase latency (for example if 2 people on the East Coast need to send traffic to each other via our West Coast switch).</p><p>  EVIX's primary purpose is for research and education, and should not be expected to increase Internet performance.</p>"
        - "<h4>How is traffic exchanged?</h4>
           <p>EVIX uses OpenVPN, EoIP, ZeroTier or GRETap tunnels to establish layer 2 connectivity and exchange IP and IPv6 data.  As with any Internet Exchange peers use BGP to send routes to each other.</p>"
        - "<h4>Where is EVIX?</h4>
           <p>Right now we have three POPs; our primary switch is in Fremont, California and we have extension switches in the Netherlands and New Zealand.  We are planning additional sites to further reduce latency.</p>

        - "<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
           <p>Participating in EVIX is free, although we do appreciate any donations to keep the infrastrutcture running.</p>"
        - "<h4>How do I join?</h4>
           <p>Anyone who holds public resources (ASN and IPv4/IPv6) is free to join EVIX to gain experience with BGP and routing.  To get started first fill out the peering request form on our <a href='/#contact'>contact page</a></p>"
